  The Private Cloud add-on to the Local Platform enables a cluster of centrally managed servers to run work tasks from a distributed team of users. 
  This is much more efficient than each quant having a full copy of data or their own GPU resources. 
  A single work server can be loaded with GPUs and a centralized copy of your company's proprietary data.
